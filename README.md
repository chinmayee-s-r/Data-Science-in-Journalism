# Data-Science-in-Journalism
Project Title: Data Science for Ethical Journalism: A Values-Driven Technical Solution
Built For: TechTangle: Research Edition
Team: Chinmayee R. & Rutuja

🧠 Overview:
This project explores how core principles of ethical journalism — Truth, Independence, Fairness, Humanity, and Accountability — can be programmatically upheld using transparent, non-AI data science techniques.

🔍 Problem Statement:
In an age of misinformation and sensationalist media, how can we empower readers and journalists with tools that detect bias, ensure accuracy, and preserve integrity in real-time — without black-box AI?

🛠️ Solution:
We developed an end-to-end, interpretable system that takes in any news article and evaluates it against the 5 principles of journalism using deterministic, statistical methods. From detecting manipulated statistics and emotional bias to measuring source diversity and tracking public sentiment on corrections — our solution acts as a journalistic conscience.

🧪 Key Features:

Fact integrity checks (e.g., using TF-IDF + logistic regression for fake news)

Source and bias quantification (e.g., lexical scoring, sentiment polarity)

Engagement survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier curves for article retention)

News summarization templates for clarity and transparency

Dashboard to visualize bias trends over time

🔗 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Dash, Plotly, Lifelines, Jinja2, VADER Sentiment, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy

🎯 Impact:
Our project demonstrates that it's possible to audit media ethics at scale using explainable, math-driven tools — without relying on opaque AI models. It’s a plug-and-play solution for conscious readers, journalists, and media watchdogs.
